I started my breakdown of the layout of the Google Play We page by first finding the largest blocks of space and the most recognizable parts of the page. The largest piece of the page is the header block. The header block contains almost all of the categories needed to navigate to the site, so this allows a user to quickly get to any part of the site they are looking to see.
The largest piece of content on the page is the main content area, which is the set of "Top Games." This part of the page appears at the start of the page and directs the user's eye to the latest and freshest content offered on the site.

Having identified the main content area, I systematically separated out the other areas of content in less recognized ways but that still contain some relevance to the purpose of the site. These smaller content areas contain many smaller "sub-main" content areas like "Curated Game Picks" and "Recommended Games." These smaller sub-main areas help personalize or suggest particular content to each user.
I also separated out a large game banner for a game that is anticipated for release. This area is also separate from all of the other content areas on the page, as it is visually different when compared with everything else on the page.

There are also smaller blocks of content that I grouped together and recognized that they belong next to one another on the site as a group of Featured Games and as a footer block. The featured games block continues the thematic approach of displaying curated content while the footer area helps to end the site with additional links to maintain usefulness within the content on the page.
