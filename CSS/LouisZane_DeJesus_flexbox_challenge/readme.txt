Properly nesting containers made using Flexbox was challenging was the most challenging part I faced in this task.
I resolved this challenge when I applied properties such as display: flex; flex-direction; and gap to each parent container, and iteratively tested each layout within the browser until it was completed as required.
This took me 45 minutes along with the adjustments.
